However, they need to learn to look before taking action to reach their lofty goals. That’s not easy because they tend to be impatient. They’re also competitive and will do whatever they can to be the best. While enthusiastic, they can be hot-headed, although their anger rarely lasts.'),

They like to live the “good life” and will work hard to acquire material success. They also have a knack for attracting abundance, which means most eventually achieve a comfortable life. Tauruses tend to be even-keeled emotionally. This makes it great for them to be nearby when a crisis strikes. The shadow sides of Taurus are possessiveness and obstinance. When they are in that headspace, they can become unreasonable. '),

The more education they can get, the better. Communication falls under their realm, which means they love to talk. They have plenty to say and never run out of topics to discuss. This love of conversation often leads to an aptitude for languages. Many Geminis are bilingual. Variety is essential to their happiness. This can cause them to flit about from one activity - or partner - to another, leaving chaos and confusion in their wake. As they get older, they settle down. Even so, they’re always looking for the next cool thing.'),

Virgos are perfectionists. This shows up in their work. They take pride in doing an excellent job. These tendencies mean they are fantastic employees.

Earning that trust doesn’t come easy. They’ll secretly worry about your loyalty even when they let you in. Every Scorpio has psychic abilities of some sort.

Wanderlust is part of their personality, meaning they have difficulty staying in one place. Many of them will roam the world, broadening their perspective. At times, they can be too trusting.

You’ll rarely meet a snobby Aquarius. They’re tolerant and able to be friends with almost anyone. Intellectual pursuits make them happy. It’s even better when they share them with friends. Despite their friendly exterior, they can be emotionally unavailable. They try to intellectualize their emotions rather than going with what they feel. '),

They’re also responsive to other people’s emotions, which means they can be easily influenced by their loved ones. This can lead to a reputation for being wishy-washy or gullible. In worse cases, they can be taken advantage of. Despite that, Pisces are kind, compassionate, and always willing to help those in need. They can make great sacrifices for people they love or for good causes. Pisces have a strong sixth sense. When they get a feeling about a situation, they should always trust it. ');
