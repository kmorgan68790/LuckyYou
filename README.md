# LuckyYou
# Capstone

## Introduction

LuckyYou is a java-based application I created for my Dev10 capstone project for their JAVA,SQL,React training program. The application allows a user to login or sign up and receive personalized zodiac, numerology, and concord readings based on their date of birth and full birth name. For the front-end there is a version of the website that displays if users are not logged in, and if they are logged in there is a log out and edit option along with a LuckyMe page that displays the numerology, zodiac, an concord calcuations for that particular user. The edit option allows a user to change their name, password, email, and username, but the date of birth is not allowed to be edited. When the users change their name they are taken back to the LuckyMe page, which shows updated calculations for the user. If a user is not logged/signed in they can still view the zodiac, numerology, and concord pages which will contain a general overview for each page. 

The business idea behind LuckyYou is enabling users to recieve accurate zodiac, numerology, and concord readings for each aspect of their life in order to increase their luck in career, love, money, health, and more. 

## Technical Requirements

1. PostgreSql database (new technology used for this capstone)
2. DB Designer for database planning
3. Spring Boot, MVC (@RestController), JdbcTemplate, Testing
4. An HTML and CSS UI built with React
5. Figma for wireframing and prototyping
6. One UI secured by role (LuckyMe page)
7. JUnit and Mockito for testing the domain and service layers.

## Learning Goal

The learning goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to learn independently and make a project unique using a technology that wasn't covered in the course. 

## Approach

I was given two weeks to build full-stack application for my Dev10 capstone: 
    - Week 1 I worked on and finished all of my back-end coding and database creation 
    - Week 2 I mostly worked on my front-end coding and styling and added some new features to my back-end 

## Deliverables

1. A schedule of concrete tasks and project-structure and use-cases
2. Diagrams: database schema, classes, layers
3. Wireframes and prototypes
4. A short presentation, 4 to 6 slides, describing the problem my project solves, the user experience, and the technologies used
5. Complete project source code free of compiler errors
8. A complete test suite with most of the tests passing
